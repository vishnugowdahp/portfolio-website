                     data-description="Description: Developed an autonomous laser weed remover using an Arduino microcontroller and Arduino C++, designed to detect and eliminate weeds in agricultural fields as an eco-friendly alternative to chemical herbicides, minimizing environmental impact. The system uses infrared or optical sensors to distinguish weeds from crops based on size and shape, ensuring precise targeting of only unwanted plants. A high-powered laser then eliminates the identified weeds accurately, leaving crops unaffected. The Arduino microcontroller controls the weed detection algorithms, sensor data processing, and laser positioning for efficient operation. This laser weed remover reduces the need for manual labor and chemical treatments, autonomously detecting and removing weeds in real-time. It supports sustainable farming practices, benefiting both crop health and environmental sustainability.">
